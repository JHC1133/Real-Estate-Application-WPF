This project is a application made as a part of a C# and .NET programming course taken for my Bachelor's degree. Developed using C# and WPF, it applies the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It also incorporates a three-layer architecture combined with a MVVM pattern for separation of concerns. The project includes features like dynamic binding, abstract classes, interfaces, Generics and XML serialization.

- **Three-Layer Architecture**: Separation of concerns via Presentation Layer (PL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Data Access Layer (DAL).
  
- **OOP Concepts**: Utilizes dynamic binding, interfaces, and abstract classes to demonstrate polymorphism and inheritance.
  
- **Generics & Collections**: Manages property listings and related data using List<T> and Dictionary<T> collections.
  
- **Serialization**: Supports binary and XML file formats for data persistence.
  
- **Additonal Architecture**: Uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a structured GUI implementation.
