This WPF project implements a real estate management system using core object-oriented programming principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The system features:

- Three-Layer Architecture: Separation of concerns via Presentation Layer (PL), Business Logic Layer (BLL), and Data Access Layer (DAL).
- OOP Concepts: Utilizes dynamic binding, interfaces, and abstract classes to demonstrate polymorphism and inheritance.
- Generics & Collections: Manages property listings and related data using List<T> and Dictionary<T> collections.
- Serialization: Supports binary and XML file formats for data persistence.
- Uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern for a structured GUI implementation.
